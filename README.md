# Comprehensive Crime Analysis and Reduction Strategy - Montgomery County (2016-2022)

## Introduction

The Comprehensive Crime Analysis and Reduction Strategy for Montgomery County addresses the urgent issue of crime from 2016 to 2022. This initiative involves a meticulous approach, beginning with data preparation and cleaning, followed by a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Through diverse datasets and various data visualization techniques, including interactive maps, heatmaps, bar charts, and time series graphs, we aim to unveil hidden patterns, crime hotspots, seasonal effects, and demographic-crime connections. The results aim to empower law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and researchers for informed decision-making to effectively reduce crime and enhance public safety.

## Results for kNN and Naive Bayes Models

### Naive Bayes Model

- **Model:** Naive Bayes
- **Accuracy:** 92.29%
- **Classification Report:**
  - **Precision:**
    - Class "False": 0.99
    - Class "True": 0.82
  - **Recall:**
    - Class "False": 0.89
    - Class "True": 0.99
  - **F1-score:**
    - Class "False": 0.94
    - Class "True": 0.90
  - **Support:**
    - Class "False": 30,360
    - Class "True": 15,492
- **Macro Avg F1-score:** 0.92
- **Weighted Avg F1-score:** 0.92

### Interpretation

**kNN:**
- Good overall accuracy.
- Slightly lower performance on Class "True" compared to Naive Bayes.
- Balanced performance with reasonable precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes.

**Naive Bayes:**
- Well-performing, especially in terms of recall for Class "True."
- Lower precision for Class "True" compared to kNN.

### Comparison

The choice between models depends on specific application goals. If high recall for Class "True" is crucial, Naive Bayes might be preferred. For a more balanced performance, kNN could be a suitable choice. Context and the importance of precision and recall metrics based on the consequences of false positives and false negatives should be considered.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the detailed analysis of the Montgomery County Crimes dataset from 2016 to 2022 provides valuable insights into crime patterns. The careful steps in data preparation, time-based and crime-type analysis, and crime mapping enhance our understanding. Machine learning, specifically k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Naive Bayes models, improves prediction accuracy after advanced data preparation techniques. This study emphasizes the importance of cleaning and preparing data for predictive models, showcasing the power of data science and machine learning in aiding law enforcement strategies to prevent crime. The knowledge gained can inform future efforts to enhance public safety and reduce crime rates in Montgomery County. This project highlights the impactful role of data analysis and machine learning in decision-making and problem-solving for community safety.
