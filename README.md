# Comprehensive Crime Analysis and Reduction Strategy - Montgomery County (2016-2022)

## Introduction

The Comprehensive Crime Analysis and Reduction Strategy for Montgomery County addresses the urgent issue of crime from 2016 to 2022. This initiative involves a meticulous approach, beginning with data preparation and cleaning, followed by a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Through diverse datasets and various data visualization techniques, including interactive maps, heatmaps, bar charts, and time series graphs, we aim to unveil hidden patterns, crime hotspots, seasonal effects, and demographic-crime connections. The results aim to empower law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and researchers for informed decision-making to effectively reduce crime and enhance public safety.


## PCA Results README

### Overview:

This section provides an overview of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) results, showcasing the variance explained by each principal component and the cumulative explained variance ratio.

### Principal Components and Explained Variance:

- **Principal Component 1:** Explains about 19.35% of the variance.
- **Principal Component 2:** Contributes an additional 16.79%.
- **Principal Component 3 and beyond:** Each subsequent component adds to the cumulative explained variance.

### Cumulative Explained Variance:

- The first three principal components capture approximately 49.69% of the total variance.
- To achieve 80% variance coverage, around 12 principal components are required.

### PCA Results Table:

The PCA results table details the explained variance for each principal component and the cumulative explained variance.

- **Principal Component:** Index ranging from 1 to 12.
- **Explained Variance Ratio:** Proportion of variance explained by each principal component.

### Interpretation:

The interpretation section delves into the significance of the results:

- **First Principal Component:** Explains approximately 19.32% of the variance.
- **First Two Components:** Combined explain about 36.06% of the variance.
- **Cumulative Explained Variance:** Reaches approximately 91.5% by the eighth principal component.

### Implications:

The PCA results suggest that the first eight principal components capture around 81% of the variance. This reduction in dimensionality can accelerate model training while retaining a substantial portion of the original information. The choice of 12 components appears to strike a balance between dimensionality reduction and information retention.

### Interpretation

**kNN:**
- Good overall accuracy.
- Slightly lower performance on Class "True" compared to Naive Bayes.
- Balanced performance with reasonable precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes.

**Naive Bayes:**
- Well-performing, especially in terms of recall for Class "True."
- Lower precision for Class "True" compared to kNN.

### Comparison

The choice between models depends on specific application goals. If high recall for Class "True" is crucial, Naive Bayes might be preferred. For a more balanced performance, kNN could be a suitable choice. Context and the importance of precision and recall metrics based on the consequences of false positives and false negatives should be considered.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the detailed analysis of the Montgomery County Crimes dataset from 2016 to 2022 provides valuable insights into crime patterns. The careful steps in data preparation, time-based and crime-type analysis, and crime mapping enhance our understanding. Machine learning, specifically k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Naive Bayes models, improves prediction accuracy after advanced data preparation techniques. This study emphasizes the importance of cleaning and preparing data for predictive models, showcasing the power of data science and machine learning in aiding law enforcement strategies to prevent crime. The knowledge gained can inform future efforts to enhance public safety and reduce crime rates in Montgomery County. This project highlights the impactful role of data analysis and machine learning in decision-making and problem-solving for community safety.
